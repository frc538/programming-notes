## Software and Accounts

If you do not already have an account, you should create one at [GitHub](https://www.github.com). Once you have an account, you can be added to the team.

If you wish to install software on your computer, these are the components installed for this session:
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) (for users not already experienced with the `git` command-line tool)
- [FRC Game Tools](https://www.ni.com/en/support/downloads/drivers/download.frc-game-tools.html#479842) (Version 2023 Patch 1) - note that this is a Windows-only piece of software (Windows 10 or Windows 11)
- [WPILib](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/releases/tag/v2023.4.3)

The FRC Game Tools installation includes Driver Station, while the WPILib installation includes Visual Studio Code and Shuffleboard.

In addition, we reviewed two useful sources of information:
- [WPILib Documentation](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/index.html). A good first-stop if you are learning more about a topic in robot programming or control systems.
- [Chief Delphi](https://www.chiefdelphi.com). **The** primary community forum for FRC teams. Great for finding answers to specific questions.
