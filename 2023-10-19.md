# Session 03

## Summary

In this session, we did not cover additional programming material. Instead, we looked at the *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> Robotics Competition (FRC) Control System to give us an idea of how motors and motor controllers interact.

You can read the [Control System Overview from the WPILib docs](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/controls-overviews/control-system-hardware.html) for an overview. When referring to the diagrams, our team tends to use the REV components over the CTRE components, wherever there is an option present, in most situations.

We did some wiring on a basic control system setup. Most of the information should be available in the [Introduction to FRC Robot Wiring](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-1/intro-to-frc-robot-wiring.html).

## Major Control System Components

While we covered *most* of the components of the FRC Control System, we certainly didn't review all of them. The ones we covered in-depth include:
- [Battery](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/controls-overviews/control-system-hardware.html#robot-battery)
- [Main Breaker](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/controls-overviews/control-system-hardware.html#a-circuit-breaker)
- [REV Power Distribution Hub (PDH)](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/controls-overviews/control-system-hardware.html#rev-power-distribution-hub)
- [NI roboRIO](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/controls-overviews/control-system-hardware.html#ni-roborio)
- [REV Radio Power Module (RPM)](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/controls-overviews/control-system-hardware.html#rev-radio-power-module)
- [OpenMesh Radio](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/controls-overviews/control-system-hardware.html#openmesh-om5p-an-or-om5p-ac-radio)
- [Robot Signal Light (RSL)](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/controls-overviews/control-system-hardware.html#robot-signal-light)

In addition, we briefly mentioned some of the other components that are outside of the scope of motor discussion (or that we do not typically use on our team):
- [CTRE Power Distribution Panel (PDP)](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/controls-overviews/control-system-hardware.html#ctre-power-distribution-panel)
- [CTRE Voltage Regular Module (VRM)](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/controls-overviews/control-system-hardware.html#ctre-voltage-regulator-module)
- [REV Pneumatics Hub (PH)](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/controls-overviews/control-system-hardware.html#rev-pneumatic-hub)

## Motor Controllers

You can read up on the [general motor controller documentation from WPILib](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/controls-overviews/control-system-hardware.html), but some of the key details we discussed are:
- When programming, you do not actually command or instruct the *motor* - your code acts on the *motor controller*
- The *motor controller* receives the full power available from the Power Distribution Hub and sends to the *motor* only what is needed to fulfill the instruction it is working to complete
- Some motors, like the Falcon 500 have an integrated motor controller (the [TalonFX](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/controls-overviews/control-system-hardware.html#talonfx-motor-controller)), so the motor controller and motor appear as a single device
- Other motors have a completely separate motor controller device, so it is obvious the devices are independent, like the REV NEO motor and [REV Spark MAX](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/controls-overviews/control-system-hardware.html#spark-max-motor-controller) motor controller

The distinction between motor and motor controller is important to remember, because when you write code for controlling motors, you won't really see references to the *motors* - everything will refer to the *motor controllers*.
