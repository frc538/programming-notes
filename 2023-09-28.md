# Session 02

## Summary

In this session, we accomplished:
- Reading the value of a button on the joystick in different ways
- Reading the value of an axis on the joystick
- Reading the value of the POV on the joystick


## Buttons

Last time, we saw that you can report if a button is currently being pressed using the `getRawButton` method of a `Joystick`:
```java
@Override
public void robotPeriodic() {
    boolean button = testJoystick.getRawButton(1);
    SmartDashboard.putBoolean("Button", button);
}
```

The key thing to know about `getRawButton` is that it will only tell you if the button is **currently** pressed or not. Unfortunately, a robot does not process time exactly the same way that a person does. For example, when I press a button, I can know if it is pressed or not the entire time that I am pressing it. Robot code processes time a little differently.

Remember that the `periodic` functions only run one time every (approximately) 20 ms. This means that the robot can only *check* if the button has been pressed every 20 ms. It's possible to press and release the button so quickly that the robot misses the press entirely - meaning you could try to tell the robot to do something (by pressing a button), but it would never *see* the button press, so it wouldn't do what you expected.

Fortunately, WPILib has a couple of tools to help with this problem. One is the `getRawButtonPressed` method, which you can use almost exactly like the `getRawButton` method:

```java
@Override
public void robotPeriodic() {
    // Get Raw Button
    boolean button = testJoystick.getRawButton(1);
    SmartDashboard.putBoolean("Button", button);

    // Get Raw Button Pressed
    boolean pressed = testJoystick.getRawButtonPressed(1);
    SmartDashboard.putBoolean("Pressed", pressed);
}
```

As we saw before, the method will give us a `boolean` value (meaning a `true` or `false`) value, so we can use `SmartDashboard`'s `putBoolean` method to show it. We do have to use a different *key* (`"Pressed"` vs. `"Button"`) so that we get two different tiles on Shuffleboard instead of one. Up to this point, though, it should all look *almost* the same when you simulate the code - but there is a difference in behavior.

While `getRawButton` will tell you, "Is the button *currently* pressed," the new method `getRawButtonPressed` will actually tell you, "Has the button **changed** from `not pressed` to `pressed` **since the last time we checked**." This will allow the button presses to register with the robot code even if they happen between those 20 ms `periodic` checks.

For that reason, you will usually prefer `getRawButtonPressed` to `getRawButton`, but there's another problem to consider - this time, a human one.

Often times, a person can press a button just a little too early, causing an action to occur before they really intended. The `getRawButtonPressed` method does not provide much safety against this scenario - but there is a method that does. The `getRawButtonReleased` method works by reporting when a button has gone from **being pressed** to **not being pressed**, and you use it almost exactly how you use the other two methods.

```java
@Override
public void robotPeriodic() {
    // Get Raw Button
    boolean button = testJoystick.getRawButton(1);
    SmartDashboard.putBoolean("Button", button);

    // Get Raw Button Pressed
    boolean pressed = testJoystick.getRawButtonPressed(1);
    SmartDashboard.putBoolean("Pressed", pressed);

    // Get Raw Button Released
    boolean released = testJoystick.getRawButtonReleased(1);
    SmartDashboard.putBoolean("Released", released);
}
```

Using this method, if an operator presses the button too early, they are able to hold the button down and wait to let go when the robot is in the *actual* position they want. This is works because `getRawButtonReleased` does not register as `true` **until the button gets let go**, while the other methods register as `true` *when the button gets pressed*.

Using these three methods works with any *buttons* on the joystick - just remember that buttons do **not include** anything that "wiggles" (like a thumbstick or a trigger), nor does it include anything resembling a D-Pad. The joysticks we typically use off-the-shelf have about 10 buttons total, and the first button is button `1`. As a reminder, you can figure out which button has which number by plugging in the joystick and looking in Driver Station.

Again, in all three cases, the button is either *in that state* (currently pressed, changed from not-pressed to pressed, or changed from pressed to not-pressed), which is `true`, or the button is *not in that state*, which registers `false`. For this reason, we capture the value of the method as a `boolean` in all three cases.


## Axes

When working with buttons, it made sense to use `boolean` values because there are only two possible states for the button. There are many times where we have a limited number of possible outcomes. We say that these scenarios are *countable* - we can count (easily) how many possible outcomes there are. We also say that the values are *discrete* - meaning that the states are completely separate and distinct. For example, a button cannot be both *pressed* and *not pressed* - it can only be one. This is similar to the concept of something being *digital* - which we will see again in later concepts.

For other things we want to examine, it may not be possible to list out (or *enumerate*) all possible states. It could be that our measurement could take on *any* value within a *range* of (nearly) infinitely many values. In this case, the values are not quite discrete, they are much closer to the concept of being *continuous* and are more similar to the concept of *analog* in electronics.

While a button is like the *discrete* example, an axis is more like the *continuous* example. On a gamepad, you can find axes in the triggers and on the thumbsticks. On a flightstick, you can find axes in the joystick itself and in any sliders or paddles. In general, axes can give a value between `-1.0` and `+1.0`, though some only go between `-1.0` and `0.0` or `0.0` and `+1.0`. Most axes, by default, will start at `0.0`, but they can take on any values in those range.

It's also important to know that some parts of a joystick may be made of multiple axes. For example, the left thumb stick on a gamepad has one axis for the left-right motion and another for the up-down motion. You can see which axis maps to which component/direction in Driver Station, the same way you did for buttons. Just know that while buttons started at button `1`, axes start with axis `0`.

We will start by reading off a value from axis `0`. While buttons had only two possible states and we were able to use a `boolean` to capture that value, axes report their values as decimal numbers - which we will refer to as *real numbers*. These real numbers can be positive, negative, or zero, and may include a decimal point. In Java, we use the `double` data type to hold real numbers. (In earlier programming days, we used a type called a `float` - which can still be used today - but it was later replaced by a data type that could store twice the information, hence `double`.) Because `double` is just another type in Java, we can store values in a similar way.

```java
@Override
public void robotPeriodic() {
    // Code for buttons is above somewhere
    ...
    double axis0 =
}
```

To read an axis from a `Joystick`, we use the `getRawAxis` method for axis `0`.

```java
@Override
public void robotPeriodic() {
    // Code for buttons is above somewhere
    ...
    double axis0 = testJoystick.getRawAxis(0);
}
```

We can also use the `SmartDashboard` reference to show the value to the user, but we can't use `putBoolean`, because the value we have is not a `boolean`. Instead, when putting numbers on display in Shuffleboard, we want to use the `putNumber` method, which takes a *key* and *value* just like `putBoolean` did. The only difference is that the value we give it must be a number of some type (like a `double`), not a `boolean`.

```java
@Override
public void robotPeriodic() {
    // Code for buttons is above somewhere
    ...
    double axis0 = testJoystick.getRawAxis(0);
    SmartDashboard.putNumber("Axis 0", axis0);
}
```

When you simulate this code in Driver Station, Shuffleboard will add a tile. Moving the axis to and fro will change the value displayed, similar to how the buttons worked - just with a different format of display.

In general, left-right axes will use `-1.0` for full left and `+1.0` for full right. Up-down axes will use `-1.0` for full *up* and `+1.0` for full *down*. The reason for this convention goes back to how pilots control aircraft, which is why the value might *seem* inverted.

Axes *usually* report `0` in the center of their travel (*e.g.*, the exact middle of left and right), but axes may report `0` for a range of values. This is what we call a *deadband*. It basically means that if the axis is *close enough* to the `0` position, then it will report `0` as its value. This could be the first 10% of motion on either side or some other custom value. This is something that can be configured in many cases, and we'll look at it more in depth at some point.


## POV (D-Pad)

The last part of the joystick to consider is the directional-pad (sometimes called the D-Pad). In WPILib, this part of the controller is referred to as a `POV` (point-of-view). This component is not treated like a button, nor is it treated like an axis - it behaves differently from either.

Like an axis, the POV can take on several different values - but like a button there is a limited number of them (they are *discrete* values). Its value is always reported as a number, so a `boolean` is not the right data type to use. You might think to use a `double`, but these values never have a decimal value - so a `double` would be overkill. Instead, the POV always reports an integer value, that is, a positive number, a negative number, or zero **with no decimal component**. This means the POV *could* take on a value like `5` but not `5.4`. When working with integer values, we will most often use the `int` data type.


```java
@Override
public void robotPeriodic() {
    // Code for buttons is above somewhere
    // Code for axes is above somewhere
    ...
    int pov = 
```

The value reported by the POV will be an integer that represents which direction the POV is pressed in as an angle between `0` and `360` degrees (not including `360`), using the value `-1` for a POV that is not pressed at all. The up direction is `0` degrees and the angle increases clockwise. This is the same angle reference used by pilots, similar to how we saw up-down axes behave.

So here are some common values the POV will report and what they mean:
- `-1`: the POV is not pressed
- `0`: the POV is pressed up
- `45`: the POV is pressed up *and* right
- `90`: the POV is pressed right
- `135`: the POV is pressed right *and* down
- `180`: the POV is pressed down
- `225`: the POV is pressed down *and* left
- `270`: the POV is pressed left
- `315`: the POV is pressed left *and* up

Most POVs you encounter will only report one of these nine states, but if the POV has more precision, it could report other values between `0` and `360` degrees.

You can retrieve the value of the POV using the `getPOV` method, which will return the value of the controller's default POV component (note that some controller *may* have more than one POV).

```java
@Override
public void robotPeriodic() {
    // Code for buttons is above somewhere
    // Code for axes is above somewhere
    ...
    int pov = testJoystick.getPOV();
```

What's nice here is that `SmartDashboard` chose not to distinguish between `int` and `double` values, since both are numerical, so you can still use the `putNumber` method to report the value in Shuffleboard.

```java
@Override
public void robotPeriodic() {
    // Code for buttons is above somewhere
    // Code for axes is above somewhere
    ...
    int pov = testJoystick.getPOV();
    SmartDashboard.putNumber("POV", pov);
```

Doing so will report a tile similar to the one used for `double`s, but you won't see a decimal reported for these `int` values.

This wraps up most of the basic functionality you get from a USB joystick. There are more advanced features to general joysticks and more specific ones (like the `XboxController`). To learn more about joysticks, you can refer to [WPILib's joystick documentation](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/basic-programming/joystick.html).
